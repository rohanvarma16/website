We then state minimax lower bounds on the maximum risk for the approximately bandlimited class under these three sampling strategies and show that active sampling cannot fundamentally outperform experimentally designed sampling. We propose a recovery strategy to compare uniform sampling with experimentally designed sampling. As the proposed recovery strategy lends itself well to statistical analysis, we derive the exact mean square error for each sampling strategy. To study convergence rates, we introduce two types of graphs and find that 1) the proposed recovery strategy achieves the optimal rates; and 2) the experimentally designed sampling fundamentally outperforms uniform sampling for Type-2 class of graphs. To validate our proposed recovery strategy, we test it on five specific graphs: a ring graph with k nearest neighbors, an Erdos-Rényi graph, a random geometric graph, a small-world graph, and a power-law graph and find that experimental results match the proposed theory well. This paper also presents a comprehensive explanation for when and why sampling for semi-supervised learning with graphs works.},

Existing work has focused on approximating the least squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the noise-to-signal ratio.

We model the weather stations as nodes on a graph and model wind velocity at each station as a graph signal. We observe that the wind velocities at two close stations are similar, that is, the graph signal of wind velocities is smooth. By taking advantages of the smoothness, we only query a small fraction of it and recover the rest by using a novel graph signal recovery algorithm, which solves an optimization problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we first demonstrate the necessity to take wind into account when planning route for autonomous aerial vehicles, and then show that the proposed method produces a reliable and energy-efficient route.},

We show that perfect recovery is possible for graph signals bandlimited under the graph Fourier transform. The sampled signal coefficients form a new graph signal, whose corresponding graph structure preserves the first-order difference of the original graph signal. For general graphs, an optimal sampling operator based on experimentally designed sampling is proposed to guarantee perfect recovery and robustness to noise; for graphs whose graph Fourier transforms are frames with maximal robustness to erasures as well as for Erdös-Rényi graphs, random sampling leads to perfect recovery with high probability. We further establish the connection to the sampling theory of finite discrete-time signal processing and previous work on signal recovery on graphs. To handle full-band graph signals, we propose a graph filter bank based on sampling theory on graphs. Finally, we apply the proposed sampling theory to semi-supervised classification of online blogs and digit images, where we achieve similar or better performance with fewer labeled samples compared to previous work.},

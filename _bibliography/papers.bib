  abstract = {Signals on multiple graphs may model IoT scenarios consisting of a local wireless sensor network performing sets of acquisitions that must be sent to a central hub that may be far from the measurement field. Rakeness-based design of compressed sensing is exploited to allow the administration of the tradeoff between local communication and the long-range transmission needed to reach the hub. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations incorporating real world figures in terms of communication consumption show a potential energy saving from 25\% to almost 50\% with respect to a direct approach not exploiting local communication and rakeness.},

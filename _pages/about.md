Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Rohan Varma and I am a fifth year graduate student in the ECE department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I am broadly interested in machine learning, signal processing and interdisciplinary work drawing from tools in optimization and information theory.

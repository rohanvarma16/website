Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Rohan Varma and I am a fifth year graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh advised by Prof. Jelena Kovačević.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, signal processing and interdisciplinary work drawing from tools in optimization and information theory.

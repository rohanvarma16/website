  abstract = {Signals on multiple graphs may model IoT scenarios consisting of a local wireless sensor network performing sets of acquisitions that must be sent to a central hub that may be far from the measurement field. Rakeness-based design of compressed sensing is exploited to allow the administration of the tradeoff between local communication and the long-range transmission needed to reach the hub. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations incorporating real world figures in terms of communication consumption show a potential energy saving from 25\% to almost 50\% with respect to a direct approach not exploiting local communication and rakeness.},

In particular, the theory uses ideas from geometric functional analysis to show that the algorithm can accurately recover the underlying subspaces under minimal requirements on their orientation, and on the number of samples per subspace. Synthetic as well as real data experiments complement our theoretical study, illustrating our approach and demonstrating its effectiveness.},

By contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the ``mass'' in the responses and the optimal objective value.},

Sparsity on graphs and, in particular, the characterization of the subspaces of signals which are sparse with respect to the connectivity of the graph, as induced by analysis with a suitable graph operator, remains in general an opaque concept which we aim to elucidate. By leveraging the theory of cosparsity, we present a novel (co)sparse graph Laplacian-based signal model and characterize the underlying (structured) (co)sparsity, smoothness and localization of its solution subspaces on undirected graphs, while providing more refined statements for special cases such as circulant graphs. Ultimately, we substantiate fundamental discrepancies between the cosparse analysis and sparse synthesis models in this structured setting, by demonstrating that the former constitutes a special, constrained instance of the latter.},

We also show, again assuming only knowledge of the \$\textbackslash{}ell\_2\$ error rate, that a simple post-processing step can be used to eliminate spurious estimated changepoints, and thus delivers an (approximate) changepoint recovery property---specifically, in addition to the screening property described above, we are assured that each estimated jump has a true jump nearby. As a special case, we focus on the application of these results to the 1-dimensional fused lasso, i.e., 1-dimensional total variation denoising, and compare the implications with existing results from the literature. We also study extensions to related problems, such as changepoint detection over graphs.},

Although many theoretical results that are available in a simple case\textemdash{}single-measurement vector (SMV)\textemdash{}the theoretical analysis regarding MMV is lacking. In this paper, some known results of SMV are generalized to MMV. Some of these new results take advantages of additional information in the formulation of MMV. We consider the uniqueness under both an 0-norm-like criterion and an 1-norm-like criterion. The consequent equivalence between the 0-norm approach and the 1-norm approach indicates a computationally efficient way of finding the sparsest representation in a redundant dictionary. For greedy algorithms, it is proven that under certain conditions, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) can find the sparsest representation of an MMV with computational efficiency, just like in SMV. Simulations show that the predictions made by the proved theorems tend to be very conservative; this is consistent with some recent advances in probabilistic analysis based on random matrix theory. The connections will be discussed.},

  abstract = {The fused lasso, also known as (anisotropic) total variation denoising, is widely used for piecewise constant signal estimation with respect to a given undirected graph. The fused lasso estimate is highly nontrivial to compute when the underlying graph is large and has an arbitrary structure. But for a special graph structure, namely, the chain graph, the fused lasso\textemdash{}or simply, 1d fused lasso\textemdash{}can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we revisit a result recently established in the online classification literature (Herbster et al., 2009; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2013) and show that it has important implications for signal denoising on graphs. The result can be translated to our setting as follows. Given a general graph, if we run the standard depth-first search (DFS) traversal algorithm, then the total variation of any signal over the chain graph induced by DFS is no more than twice its total variation over the original graph.},
